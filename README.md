# GA-Project-1
## RPG Boy

### Description
- Control a pixel character to hunt and kill several monsters.
- Clear the level by killing all of them before the alotted time.
- Be weary of losing too much health or you could die!

### Technologies used
- Javascript
  - Canvas
  - Canvas was used to facillitate free-movement and fast framework, which the final product of the game was intended to require.
  - As it was something that class did not touch on, I wanted to challenge myself and learn something completely new. It was difficult and actually stil is, but after spending a       week on this project, I've grown more comfortable with it, and can manipulate it far better than i could before.
