	<< GAME CONCEPT 1 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

- Memory Game
    - Images come out in a grid format.
    - There is a timer that goes up.
    - Everytime you click on a tile, it flips them
        - It triggers a function and they stays that way if the two tiles are identical.

    - Game ends when all pairs have been triggered. (all functions are true)
    
    - At the start, the tiles are shuffled. 
        - Then flipped once for 4 seconds before theyre flipped back.

    - End Game
        - All tiles are flipped and connected correctly.












        














    << GAME CONCEPT 2 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

  - Basic RPG-ish game using a pixel monster that goes around killing creatures.

  - pixel images will be taken from online

  - Looking at a tutorial using canvas, but if there is a way to code it without, 
    would like to try that too

 - END GAME = When timer runs out, go to screen that shows your total kills.


    << Expected Difficulties >>>>>>>>

    - Coding the controls(up,down,left,right) so that the 'Character' follows them
    
    - Coding attacks and damage numbers

    - Part 1, randomly spawn monsters
        - Part 2, let them move randomly

    - Attaching the sprites so that they change whenever arrow key is pressed.

    - The directional keys

    - Damage by pixels/squares

    >>>>

    << POSSIBLE ADDTIONS IF HAVE TIME>>>>>>>>>>

      - When the exp bar fills up, can evolve to a new creature at the end of level.
          - new creature will have new attack patterns
      - Game objects, or weapons and terrain(rocks/trees)

    -MVP
        - Can produce an attack (much like pizza rat and dougie)
            - have it materialize in html and 
            - 'kill' the enemy

        - Character can move according to controls

        - timer runs out and produces a times up.
